# Solar Cycle Forecasting via DTW Analogs and Phase-Aware Bootstrapping  

This repository contains the complete code and reproducibility package for the 
paper:

"Analog Forecasting of Solar Cycles via DTW and Residual Bootstrapping:  
Real-Time Application to Solar Cycle 25"  
Varun Soman, Amaranathan Sabarinath (2025)

The repository includes:
- DTW-based analog selection for historical solar cycles  
- Morphology-based cycle blending  
- Phase-aware residual bootstrapping for uncertainty quantification  
- Out-of-sample forecasts for Solar Cycles 25 and 26  
- Real-time update mechanism using partial SC25 observations  
- Figure-generation scripts for all plots appearing in the paper  

All computations use the SILSO v2.0 monthly-smoothed dataset  
(frozen at 2024-11 released 2024-12-01) and a fixed random seed for 
full reproducibility.
